Once upon a time, there was a little bunny named Benny. Benny loved to play hide and seek with his friends. One day, Benny wanted to hide in a hole in the ground. He went inside and found an old toy buried in the ground. He dug it up and started to play with it.
Suddenly, he heard a loud thud popping out of the hole. He tried to move out, but it was too late. The toy was stuck! Benny felt helpless and sad. He didn't know what to do.
Just then, Benny's friend, a wise owl, flew by. Benny asked the owl for help. The owl said, "I know how to get the toy out of there!" The owl flew down and used his magic powers to break the hole in the ground. Benny was so happy and grateful to his friend. He learned that sometimes, we need help from others too to turn or hide.
